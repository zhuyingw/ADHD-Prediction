Studying ADHD with Smartphone Sensing and Ecological Momentary Assessment

 

Overview

This study examines how Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) affects thoughts, feelings, and behavior in everyday life. The purpose of this research is to develop an understanding of how and when college students experience ADHD symptoms so that we can better identify and provide help to people with the disorder.



The study lasts 10 weeks and we will collect data from you in the form of questionnaires, surveys in your daily life, and data collected passively (i.e., with no effort from you) from your smartphone. You will first participate in an online or in-person session lasting up to one hour where you will fill out surveys and be instructed in installing an app on your phone that will collect data during the 10 weeks. The surveys during this session will ask you about your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors including symptoms of ADHD and other mental health disorders as well as personality traits and sleep habits. We will also ask you about your use of alcohol and tobacco products.



You will then complete one week of daily surveys on your smartphone. Throughout the week you will complete five of these short surveys a day for six days. Each cell phone survey during the week will take no more than five minutes. These surveys will ask you how you are thinking, feeling, and what you are doing in the moment.



After this week of daily surveys, you will continue to complete weekly online questionnaires for the remaining 9 weeks of the study. These will ask you about thoughts, feelings, and behaviors including symptoms of ADHD and other mental health conditions. During the 10 weeks anonymized information will be collected about your activity on your smartphone, which may include location information using GPS and wifi, activity data and, for Android users, also app use (frequency and duration), microphone activity (no audio recorded) SMS text message information (number sent and received, length, number of recipients), phone call information (number placed and received, duration, number of recipients) email information (number sent and received). Content of text messages, emails, and phone calls will not be recorded. During the study, our staff may contact you to troubleshoot if there are technical problems with the app.



Please note that, your survey responses will not be reviewed by the researchers during the study and researchers will take no action (e.g., offering mental health treatment) during your participation in the study.



You will be compensated $20 for completing the baseline study visit and installing the app on your phone. You will then receive an additional $0.50 for each daily survey completed for a maximum of $15. Those who complete 75% or more of the daily surveys (23 out of 30) will be entered into a raffle for one of two (2) $100 Amazon gift cards. Finally, you will receive $3.00 for every weekly questionnaire completed for a total of $30 additional. Thus, your total possible compensation, not including raffle winnings, is $65.00.



Contact Information



The principal investigators are Dr. Laura Knouse Dr. Shweta Ware. Should you have any questions or concerns, you can contact the investigators at lknouse@richmond.edu or sware@richmond.edu.



Voluntary Participation



You must be at least 18 years of age in order to participate in this study. Your participation is voluntary and refusal to participate will involve no penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled. You may discontinue participation at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled. In addition, you are free to refuse to answer any particular question posed during the study for any reason.



Possible Risks



The study is expected to pose minimal risk to participants. One possible risk is that completing the short surveys five times a day may distract you from your daily tasks. However, reports from participants in our prior study using daily surveys did not indicate significant disruption to their daily lives. To reduce daily intrusions of the surveys, each is designed to have an estimated completion time of less than five minutes. In addition, the window to complete each survey will last more than the duration of a class period (2 hours), which minimizes potential distraction during classes or other activities.



Another possible risk is related to personal information provided when answering some of the questions. Some questions may make you feel uncomfortable or seem intrusive. Completing the measures could cause psychological distress and uncertainty about one’s mental health. As described above, you are free to refuse to answer any particular question posed during the study for any reason. You may contact the Principle Investigators, Dr. Laura Knouse and Dr. Shweta Ware, or the University of Richmond IRB chair if you have any concerns.



Another possible risk is disruption to daily life as a result of unforeseen technical issues with the app. If technical issues occur, please contact us and we will do our best to resolve the issue. We may also contact you if we see a problem with the app and help you resolve it. In addition, you may choose to opt out of use of the app without penalty.



A final possible risk is disclosure of identifiable personal data. Please see the Confidentiality of Records section, below, describing how we will protect your information.



Possible Benefits



There may be no direct benefit to you by participating in this study. This research may benefit college students by improving our understanding of ADHD in daily life. In addition, in the future data from smartphones could be used to help diagnose ADHD or tell us more about who could benefit from treatment.



Confidentiality of Records



Your confidentiality will be maintained through use of an identification number that will link your responses. The identification number will be assigned to you so no contact information is directly linked to your data; that is your name and contact information will not be directly associated with the information you provide during lab sessions or on your cell phone. We will store your identification number and identifying information in a separate file on our secure server. Smartphone data is anonymized and either encrypted or sent via a secure channel (HTTPS) to our secure servers. After completion of the study, your identifying information will be deleted. Once this identifiable private information is deleted, then the de-identified data may be used for future research studies.



Finally, due to the inclusion of questions regarding alcohol and tobacco use, we have obtained a Certificate of Confidentiality for this study from the federal government, which protects your privacy by prohibiting disclosure of identifiable, sensitive research information to anyone not connected to the research, including protecting it from disclosure in any Federal, State, or local civil, criminal, administrative, legislative, or other proceeding.



Use of Information and Data Collected



The data we collect from this study may be presented at conferences or published in papers; however, your name or other identifying information will never be used in these presentations or papers.



Protection and Rights



If you have any questions concerning your rights as a research participant, you may contact the Chair of the University of Richmond’s Institutional Review Board for the Protection of Human Participants at (804) 289-8461 or irb@richmond.edu for information or assistance.



Statement of Consent



The study has been described to me and I understand that my participation is voluntary and that I am free to withdraw my consent and discontinue my participation in the project at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which I am otherwise entitled. I affirmatively consent to the internal, non-public disclosure of my email address solely for the purposes of internal use within the Knouse research lab to facilitate communications related to the study. I understand that my contact information will not be publicly available. I also understand that the results of the study will be treated in strict confidence. I understand that if I have any questions or concerns about this study, I may direct them to the investigators, Dr. Laura Knouse and Dr. Shweta Ware, at lknouse@richmond.edu or sware@richmond.edu. I have read and understand the above information and I consent to participate in this study by indicating my consent below.
